# PostIt - WAD Homework 1

A responsive three-page website built with HTML5 and CSS for the Web Application Development course at the University of Tartu.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in a browser, or run the following command from the project folder:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then open http://localhost:8000. No additional packages or build step are required.

## Project structure

| File           | Purpose                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.html`   | Home page with five posts, including image and text-only posts   |
| `addPost.html` | Form with a post body, image file picker, and Create post button |
| `login.html`   | Login form with required email and password fields               |
| `styles.css`   | Shared styles, CSS selectors, and responsive Flexbox layouts     |
| `script.js`    | JavaScript for the interactive like buttons                      |
| `assets/`      | Local illustrations used in the posts                            |

## Features

* Home and Add Post navigation links with background changes on hover.
* Five different posts, each containing text, an author icon, a date, and a like button.
* Interactive like buttons implemented with JavaScript. Clicking a like button finds the `<span>` inside that button and increases its displayed count by one.
* Login form validation using `required` and `type="email"`.
* Login and Create post buttons that navigate to `index.html` after submission.
* Semantic HTML elements, including `header`, `nav`, `main`, `article`, and `footer`.
* Flexbox layouts and a media query for smaller screens.

This is a static website. Login does not authenticate users, and submitting a post does not save its text or upload a file. The like count is only changed in the browser and is not stored on a server. Account creation and password recovery links display explanatory notes.

## Required CSS selectors

| Selector type    | Example                    | Use                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pseudo-class     | `.site-header nav a:hover` | Changes the navigation link background on hover               |
| Descendant       | `.site-header nav a`       | Styles navigation links inside the header                     |
| Child            | `.post > p`                | Styles paragraphs directly inside a post                      |
| Adjacent sibling | `.post-image + p`          | Sets spacing for text immediately after a post image          |
| General sibling  | `.post p ~ .like-icon`     | Styles a like icon following a paragraph with the same parent |

## Manual checks

* Follow navigation links between all three pages.
* Check the hover effect on Home and Add Post.
* Click the like buttons and confirm that the displayed like count increases.
* Confirm that the home page contains five posts and all images load.
* Confirm that login submission is blocked when either field is empty or the email is invalid.
* Confirm that a valid login form and the Create post form navigate to Home.
* Inspect the layout at desktop and mobile widths using browser developer tools.
* Validate each HTML file with the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
* Repeat navigation, image, and like button checks after deployment.

## Deployment

The website can be hosted on GitHub Pages directly from the repository root. All page and asset links use relative paths.
